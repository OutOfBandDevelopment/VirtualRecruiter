# Open-WebUI

## Summary

The [OpenWebUI](https://docs.openwebui.com/) application is an extensible, feature-rich, and user-friendly self-hosted WebUI designed to operate offline. It supports various Language Model (LLM) runners, including Ollama and OpenAI-compatible APIs. Key features of OpenWebUI include support for pipelines, user experience, conversations, model management, collaboration, history & archive, voice & accessibility, code execution, integration & security, and administration. The application is designed for users to manage and control system settings, with the first account created having administrator privileges and subsequent sign-ups requiring administrator approval for access. OpenWebUI also provides a platform for community engagement through its GitHub and Discord channels. [Source code](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/)
